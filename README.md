# Product-Defects
I am in charge of monitoring the number of products from a specific factory. I have been told that the number of defects on a given day follows the Poisson distribution with the rate parameter (lambda) equal to 7. I am new here, so I want to get a feel for what it means to follow the Poisson(7) distribution. 

I remember that the Poisson distribution is special because the rate parameter represents the expected value of the distribution, so in this case, the expected value of the Poisson(7) distribution is 7 defects per day.

I will investigate certain attributes of the Poisson(7) distribution to get an intuition for how many defective objects I should expect to see in a given amount of time. I will also practice and apply what I know about the Poisson distribution on a practice data set that I will simulate myself.
